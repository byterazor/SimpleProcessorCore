    Uart Component
---------------------

Component is a fork of the UART Component written by Marcel Eckert marcel.eckert@hsu-hh.de
at the Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg.

The main difference at the moment is the usage of the SimpleFifo Component as Fifos
not multiple Implementations for different FPGAs.
