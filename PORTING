The following steps are required to port the SPC to another FPGA board.

1. make menuconfig
2. deselect <use evaluation board>
3. put in the fpga type as required by the xilinx tool chain
4. add which number the fpga has in the boards jtag chain
5. now you can make changes to the src/top_generic.vhd and UCF/generic.ucf files
6. if everything is working fine, copy top_generic.vhd to top_<short_boardname>.vhd and generic.ucf to short_boardname.ucf
7. commit your changes with good log messages to git and make your git repository available 
8. send me a pull request and i will merge your changes into the main spc repository and add everything to kconfig
